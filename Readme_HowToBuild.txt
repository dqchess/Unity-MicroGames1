To make a build for a game...

BuildSettings
* Scenes In Build = "GameNameMainMenu", "GameNameLevelSelect", "GameName" (in that order).

PlayerSettings
* Set Product Name to game name.
* Set Default Icon to icon in Assets/Textures/[GameName]/AppIcon.png
* NOTE: Brett isn't sure about Bundle Identifier. We change that (and/or Version #) between games, right?
